# 🏫 Asociación San Gabriel Formación y Cuido de Niños

This project has been developed as part of the University Community Work (TCU) at Fidélitas University. Its main goal is to implement a web application for the comprehensive management of information related to the population served by the San Gabriel Childcare and Training Association.

The project is based on the knowledge acquired in courses on Web Application Design and Development, Client-Server Web Environment, Advanced Programming, and Advanced Web Programming.

The application will allow administrative staff to manage users, beneficiaries, groups, and programs, in addition to providing a module for error logging and auditing, thus contributing to more efficient and organized administration.

- 🛢️ [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) (database manager)
- 💻 [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (open source code editor)
- 🚀 [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/es/index.html) (includes PHP, MySQL, and Apache)

### 🔧 Setup

1. 📥 Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EnekoRAP/TCU_AsociacionSanGabriel.git
    ```

2. 🗃️ Set up the MySQL database:

   - Open XAMPP and start **Apache** and **MySQL**.
   - Go to **phpMyAdmin** by visiting `http://localhost/phpmyadmin` in your browser.
   - Create a new database called `bd_sangabriel`.
   - Import the provided SQL file `bd_sangabriel.sql` into the `bd_sangabriel` database using phpMyAdmin.

3. ⚙️ Configure the project:

   - Update the database connection settings in the `dbconnection.php` file:

   ```php
    <?php
    function abrirConexion() {
        $host = "localhost";
        $user = "root";
        $password = "";
        $db = "bd_sangabriel";
        
        $conn = new mysqli($host, $user, $password, $db);
    
        if ($conn->connect_error) {
            throw new Exception("Error de conexión a la base de datos: " . $conn->connect_error);
        }
    
        $conn->set_charset("utf8mb4");
    
        return $conn;
    }

    function cerrarConexion($conn) {
        if ($conn instanceof mysqli) {
            $conn->close();
        }
    }
    ?>
   ```
   
   Ensure the MySQL credentials and database name match your local setup.

4. ▶️ Start the XAMPP server:
